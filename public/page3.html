         <h2>Travel Packages</h2>
        <center><p>At the moment we are offering two Travel Package offers for a limited time. You do not want to miss out on these great offers! </p> </center>
        <p><u>Offer #1</u></p><br/>
        <p>Pura Vida! Travel to Costa Rica and experience a care-free and passionate way of living.</p>
        <p>This package is an inclusive trip to a resort in Tamarindo, Costa Rica! This package includes flights, the resort fee, and excursions. The beaches here in Tamarindo
          are absolutely breath-taking, but you do not want to miss out on other adventures! So the excursions we have planned include a zipling tour, surfing lesson, catamaran boat cruise,
          and Cacao Farm tour. Prices depend on how many people are traveling with you, but if you reserve your spot before March 1, 2017 each reservation will be 30% off. Contact a representative as soon as possible!
